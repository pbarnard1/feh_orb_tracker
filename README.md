# Fire Emblem Heroes orb tracker

This app organizes by month the number of Orbs one can obtain daily in Fire Emblem Heroes, a mobile game.  Orbs are the unit of currency used to obtain a Hero, a unit used for clearing maps and other modes in the game.

You can browse each month by clicking on the buttons above the table.  If you hover over each number, you'll see a tooltip pop up explaining why there are that many orbs available for that type of event for that day.  For example, hovering over August 3 in the Hero Battles row will show that we're getting 9 Orbs from Bound Hero Battle: Tiki & Nagi.

You can determine how many Orbs you can get between two dates by clicking at the top, where a modal form will pop up, and you can enter the dates, and then it'll calculate the number of Orbs that can be obtained during that time frame.
